installed samtools 
git clone git@github.com:samtools/samtools.git
need to configure with --no-ncurses
otherwise worked fine

Data source
Using this tutorial: https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/sars-cov-2/tutorial.html
We are chasing SRR11954102
This can be downloaded from s3 cp https://sra-pub-sars-cov2.s3.amazonaws.com/sra-src/SRR11954102/MA_MGH_00250.lERCC_00025_RandomHexamer_NexteraXT_RNA_311243302_cDNA_355003635_LIB_334376936.cleaned.bam.1

What's in the data?
call samtools stats 
This is an UNREFERENCED bam file. It's basically a refomatted FASTQ file
There are 2923020 reads
Thare are all marked as paired end reads
the length of all of them is 101
total of 295225020 bases
There are only 30000 bases in the Covid Genome, so we have 9840x coverage from this one sample

How to denovo this?
 NEXT TIME!!!
